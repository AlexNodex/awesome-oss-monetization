## Adding something to the Awesome OSS Monetization List

If you have a correction, more examples, or another monetization approach to contribute to the list, you can edit the page and create a pull request to propose a change of the file.

You'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) - if you are new to Github please have a look at the general [Awesome List Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/contributing.md)!

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
