# Monetization via Grants and Stipends

Contributions made from institutions, funds, companies, foundations, or organizations to individual maintainers, contributors, or OSS projects. Often these are large or recurring payments to enable quasi-salaries that do not require repayment.

Requires:
* Application for grant or stipend 
* Setup of a payment receiver (might require incorporation / freelancing or fiscal host)
* Recurring "documentation activites" to document the use of the funding

Variants & Options:
* Single grant: One-time contribution
* Recurring grant: Monthly recurring contributions
