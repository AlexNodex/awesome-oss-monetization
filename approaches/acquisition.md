# Monetization via Sell the Project
AKA: Acquisition

Selling the whole or parts of the project to an interested party (e.g., big company that is using it). Can become complicated if many maintainers and contributors have rights to part of the OSS. Might require an "earn-out" period where the old owners transfer knowledge to the new owner (e.g., as an always available contact person or via pair-programming sessions).

Requires:
* Clarification of copyright and revenue distribution with all involved maintainers and contributors
* Negotiation of a selling price
* Setup of a sales contract (potentially between two countries / jurisdictions)
* Time to conduct the knowledge transfer

Variants & Options:
* Partial sale: Selling a part of the project (e.g., with less external contributions or a special feature set (esp. plugins, helping tools, etc.))
* Full sale: Selling the whole project

## Platforms
* [Indiemaker](https://indiemaker.co/) (For projects with or without revenue)
* [SideProjectors](https://www.sideprojectors.com/) (For projects with or without revenue)

## Evaluation

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | Medium | Negotiations with contributors; Contract setup  
| Effort to maintain income         | N/A    | One-time sale; Multiple sales for parts possible
| Visibility                        | None   | Probably buyer must approach maintainers
| Necessity to pay                  | Low    | Might be neccessary to block competition
| Scalability                       | None   | One-time sale; Multiple sales for parts possible
| One-time Income                   | Medium | One-time sale with a price that heavily depends on OSS
| Recurring Income                  | Low    | Might be possible if parts can easily be developed & sold
| Income Stability / Predictability | None   | Unstable even if parts are sold over time
| Entry Threshold for client        | High   | Clarification of copyrights; Knowledge of Tech, etc.
| Clients needed for full income    | N/A    | Valuation probably in the range of several monthly salaries per maintainer (and depends on revenue distribution) but depends on the importance of the OSS

| Effort for marketing              | High   | Finding buyers is difficult but if many users exist might be easier
| Countervalue                      | Rights | Right to the OSS or a part thereof
| Perfect for software type         | All    | 

| Additional Work                   | Low    | Maybe extra work to transfer knowledge to buyer
| Upfront Cost                      | Low    | Might get higher if bullet-proof contracts are needed
| Continuous Cost                   | None   | 
| Recipient                         | I or C | 
| Competitors                       | None   | No other party could sell the project - but forking might be a problem

> NOTE: Due to the nature of open-source a company could fork and build it's own version without paying the old maintainers. While the license for the old code would stay, the changes and extentions made by the company would become closed-source.
