# Monetization by selling Telemetry
AKA: Pay with user data

Contributions in form of user data which is send to a server of the maintainers, who then sell this data. Should be clearly communicated to the users to clarify that this is not malicious code from a contributor. Might have legal implications (GDPR) if the value generation is problematic/illegal in a country. Often leads to recurring payments.

Requires:
* Setup of an account at a data buying platform
* Integration of data collection mechanism that sends data to specific servers
* Setup of a legal entity to accept the payments or crypto

Variants & Options:
* Anonymized Data: Collecting only anonymous data has less legal problems

## Evaluation

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | Medium | Integration of a data collection system
| Effort to maintain income         | Low    | Probably only updating subsystem
| Visibility                        | Low    | Easy to overlook by users
| Necessity to pay                  | High   | Payment is enforced by running the OSS
| Scalability                       | High   | Scales with the number of end-users
| One-time Income                   | N/A    | Value-generating subsystem probably causes recurring revenue
| Recurring Income                  | Medium | Depends on the data value and number of end-users
| Income Stability / Predictability | Medium | Easier if the clients have no alternative systems
| Entry Threshold for client        | Low    | Client only pays indirectly via his hoster/cloud for the resources. Client might need to disclose data usage to his users
| Clients needed for full income    | ?1000+ | Depends heavily on the user data value

| Effort for marketing              | None   | Will make waves but no "sale" is necessary
| Countervalue                      | OSS    | User pays for using the OSS
| Perfect for software type         | Special| Best for stand-alone systems with third-party users (e.g., blogs, LMS, etc.)
