# Monetization via Licensing the Brand
AKA: Sell use of Trademark

If your brand is well-known, attractive, and legally protected (e.g., a registered Trademark), you can get paid by companies who want to use your brand to promote their own products (e.g., claiming "Based on Moodle", "ElasticSearch inside", ...) or offerings (e.g., courses with OpenOffice, about OpenSearch, etc.). The open-source software is monetized by selling a usage license - often generating one-time income with options to generate recurring revenue.

Requires:
* Legally protected brand, trademark, log, etc. that users want to associate with
* License contract describing what, when, and how the brand can be used (and the price)

Variants & Options:
* One-time use: Licensing the brand for an event or product (version).
* Prolonged use: Licensing the brand for several month or years.

## Platforms
* N/A
