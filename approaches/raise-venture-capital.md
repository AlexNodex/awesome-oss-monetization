# Monetization via Raising Venture Capital
AKA: Founding Startup

Getting funding to build a startup / company from the OSS using venture capital. Often a very good business case is required but can result in a stable income for the next years (even if the startup is not successful).

Requires:
* Willingness to create a business / company (by all involved maintainers and maybe contributors)
* Setup of a business plan/idea
* Fund-raising

Variants & Options:
* Bootstrapped: Building a Startup without VC money - requires a already working business model
* VC Funding: Getting money to build the company makes buildup easier - but founders will loose full control

## Platforms
* Thousands of VCs and Accelerators exist to pitch a Startup idea. Examples with OSS focus:
  * [OSS Capital](https://oss.capital/)
  * [AirTree](https://www.airtree.vc/open-source-vc) (Focus on Australia/New Zealand)
  * [Open Capital](https://opencapital.vc/) (Focus on Europe)
  * [RunaCap](https://runacap.com/ross-index/) ()
