## Evaluation

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | Medium | Might require Course System and/or Certificate Hosting.
| Effort to maintain income         | Medium | Constant reminders to certify might be necessary. Updating certificates and training material might be necessary
| Visibility                        | Medium | Easy to forget, ignore, or overlook, but certified people might talk about it
| Necessity to pay                  | Low    | Might increase with the wide-spread use of the software
| Scalability                       | Low    | Scales to the time available to certify or train
| One-time Income                   | Medium | Probably based on hourly wage - but can grow with demand for training or importance of certificates
| Recurring Income                  | Low    | Only for longer training projects with companies or mult-level certificates
| Income Stability / Predictability | Low    | Too complex --> no users; Too easy to understand --> no income
| Entry Threshold for client        | Low    | Credit card is sufficient
| Clients needed for full income    | 100+   | clients per month; based on 5k USD (pre-Tax)

| Effort for marketing              | High   | 
| Countervalue                      | Work   | 
| Perfect for software type         | Big SW | Better for big, complex and widely-used software

| Additional Work                   | Medium | Extra work to conduct certifications and/or trainings

| Recipient                         | I/C    | Certificate recipients probably want a certificate from an organization - not an individual. Payments might go to an individual certifier
| Competitors                       | M      | Other maintainers might be competitors to certify. 

> NOTE: Potentially, "unofficial" certificate can also be issued by non-maintainers (i.e., just expert), which could increase the competition (or income by "licencing" the right to certify).
