# Monetization via Paid Certification

Often one-time payments for one certification or training session, but companies might need continuous flow of certifications for new employees.

Requires:
* Setup of a payment mechanism (hosted or self-build)
* Setup of online communication platform to conduct paid trainings
* Collection and description of one or more certification levels
* Time to conduct the certification or training

Variants & Options:
* Training: Maintainers works with client directly to teach the use of the software
* Certification: Maintainer conducts or oversees the certification with one or more candidates
