# Monetization via Paid Versions
AKA: Crowdfunding

Proposals from maintainers to develop major features or new versions of the software. Payments are collected via a crowdfunding platform in various tiers and can offer additional countervalues (e.g., naming the version).
Often these are one-time payments for one version, but can be repeated if the community support exists (e.g., for every minor version).

Requires:
* Setup of project description and payment mechanism (hosted or self-build)
* Description of the proposed project and description of benefits
* "Marketing activites" to inform and motivate users to pay for the project

Variants & Options:
* Single Project: Development of a new version or major feature
* Recurring Projects: Development of minor versions or features (e.g., quarterly or on demand)

## Platforms
* [Kickstarter](https://issuehunt.io/)
* [IndieGoGo](https://www.indiegogo.com/)

| Recurring Income                  | Low    | Depends on community size & will to fund
