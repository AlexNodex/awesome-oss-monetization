# Monetization via Paid Quality Assurances
AKA: Paid Support

Payments by companies to check security issues in OSS, specific SLAs, or ensure quick fixes for business-threatening problems in the OSS. Sometimes hidden behind a third-party company that quasi-employs the maintainer and pays them money.

Requires:
* Application to be part of the paid maintainers 
* Time to work on problems asap (as defined in SLAs)

Variants & Options:
* Direct contracts: Multiple companies pay maintainer/project directly
* Contracts via Middleman: Companies make contract with Middleman and Middleman with maintainers to keep bureaucratic things away from OSS team

## Platforms
* [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com/) (Middleman concept)

## Evaluation

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | Medium | Contracts require more time to define and negotiate
| Effort to maintain income         | Low    | If companies or middleman is still interested only maintenance work is required
| Visibility                        | None   | Companies or middleman seek out OSS projects
| Necessity to pay                  | Medium | Might be necessary for companies using important projects that are essential to the business-model 
| Scalability                       | Medium | Contracts with multiple companies possible
| One-time Income                   | Low    | Recurring is more common - one-time payments for emergencies maybe
| Recurring Income                  | Medium | Middleman typically capps as salary level. Direct contracts get similar to building a startup/company to fulfill SLAs
| Income Stability / Predictability | High   | If SLAs are needed and companies pay they will probably in the future. Middleman is a bottleneck - if it breaks only very few others are available
| Entry Threshold for client        | Medium | Companies need contracts with many OSS projects or middleman
| Clients needed for full income    | 1/10+  | One middleman or several companies; based on 5k USD (pre-Tax)

| Effort for marketing              | Low    | Middleman will do marketing; Direct contracts might need more
| Countervalue                      | Work   | Middleman will probably pay by the hour; Direct contracts can enable selling time to fix multiple times
| Perfect for software type         | All    | Esp. essential software that is essential to the business-model of companies
