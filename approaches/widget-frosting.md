# Monetization via Paid Bundling
AKA: Widget Frosting, Bundle with Hardware

(selling hardware on-top of OSS)_

The open-source software is monetized by selling a necessary hardware component (the widget) for it stand-alone (e.g., ) or in a bundle (e.g., a Raspberry Pi with a Linux OS). The OSS basically creates or adds value to the hardware item, which is collected when selling the hardware. Often generates one-time income with few options to generate recurring revenue.

Requires:
* Availablilty of a hardware system sellable with a premium or self-produced
* Creating bundled products with a USP on marketplaces or self-hosted eCommerce website

Variants & Options:
* Stand-alone Hardware: The hardware is sold independent of the OSS
* Hardware Bundling: Hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi, hardware wallet, ...) and OSS is sold together
* Software Bundling: The OSS (e.g., a plugin) is bundled with another commercial software and sold
* Host bundling: The OSS is installed and hosted by the maintainers and then sold as a running system (incl. account, etc.)
* Pre-Install: The OSS is pre-installed on a data storage (e.g., Kubernetes on a SD card) and sold with a margin

## Platforms
* Product marketplaces such as Amazon, Alibaba, etc.
* Auction platforms such as eBay, etc.
* eCommerce hosters such as Shopify, etc.

## Evaluation

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | High   | Requires development of additional hardware and shop
| Effort to maintain income         | Medium | Requires buying hardware parts, bundling, shipping, etc.
| Visibility                        | Medium | Buying an out-of-the-box system is very convenient
| Necessity to pay                  | Medium | Own hardware must be bought but third-party hardware can be bought from a competitor
| Scalability                       | Medium | Scales with the number of users (who want the hardware). Hardware might be useful for other applications.
| One-time Income                   | Medium | Hardware can have higher price, margin for third-party hardware might be slim
| Recurring Income                  | Low    | Might be possible for hardware updates or extensions
| Income Stability / Predictability | Low    | Higher if hardware is often updated or extended
| Entry Threshold for client        | Low    | Credit card is sufficient
| Clients needed for full income    | 500+   | based on 5k USD (pre-Tax)

| Effort for marketing              | Medium | Bundles are often convenient and offer a countervalue
| Countervalue                      | Hardw. | 
| Perfect for software type         | Big SW | Better for big, complex and hardware-specific software

| Additional Work                   | High   | Additional develoment & production effort necessary
| Upfront Cost                      | High   | Hardware production or purchasing cost
| Continuous Cost                   | Medium | Maybe Hardware development cost
| Recipient                         | C      | Might be an Individual doing a side-hustle with third-party hardware
| Competitors                       | O      | If third-party hardware is used everybady can be a competitor
