# Monetization via Widget Frosting
AKA: Bundle with Hardware

(selling hardware on-top of OSS)_





Payment for additional tools, extensions, or plug-ins that help the users work with the OSS or extends the OSS functionality.
Can be one-time paymentments for one extension or tools, but recurring payments can be realized by app-stores.

Requires:
* Setup of a payment mechanism (hosted or self-build)
* Setup of a download mechanism (hosted or self-build)
* Development of one or many tools, extensions, or plug-ins

Variants & Options:
* Tool: Development of a tool helping in the use of the OSS (e.g., UI layout designer for a frontend framework such as react.js)
* Extensions & plug-ins: Additional functionality (similar to filters in photoshop, ...)

## Platforms
* [Apple's App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) (Hosting Apps for MaosOS and iOS)
* [Microsoft's App Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/windows) (Hosting Apps for Windows)

## Evaluation

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | High   | Requires development of additional software, hosting and payment
| Effort to maintain income         | Medium | Only updates are required from time to time
| Visibility                        | Medium | Tool will probably contribute to usefullness of OSS 
| Necessity to pay                  | Low    | Extensions often convenient but not necessary
| Scalability                       | Low    | Scales with the number of users (who want the extension)
| One-time Income                   | Medium | Tools can have higher price, extensions often have lower prices
| Recurring Income                  | Low    | Might be possible for tools with recurring payments
| Income Stability / Predictability | Medium | Lower for Extensions but higher for recurring paments for tools
| Entry Threshold for client        | Low    | Credit card is sufficient
| Clients needed for full income    | 100+   | based on 5k USD (pre-Tax)

| Effort for marketing              | Medium | Extensions are often convenient and offer a countervalue
| Countervalue                      | Work   | Additional develoment effort necessary, but multiple sales possible
| Perfect for software type         | Special| Mostly Frameworks that have use for editors or products with an extension mechanism

| Additional Work                   | High   | Extra work to develop and maintain tools, etc.
| Upfront Cost                      | Medium | Will require a lawyer to setup the license and contracts
| Continuous Cost                   | Low    | Will cause costs for legal or tax related stuff (but should be covered by income)
| Recipient                         | C      | Might be only a sub-group who develop the tools, etc.
| Competitors                       | None   | Tools would have a proprietary license

> NOTE: If external developers create a similar tool or extension this could increase the competition
