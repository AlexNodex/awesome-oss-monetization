# Monetization via Sell White Label

Payments of a company for removing your brand from the OSS product and re-selling it under their own brand (maybe with additional features / plugins).

* License contract describing where, when, and how the brand can be removed (and the price)

Variants & Options:
* One-time use: Removing the brand for an event or product (version).
* Prolonged use: Removing the brand for several month or years.
