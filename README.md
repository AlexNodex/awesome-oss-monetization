# Awesome OSS Monetization
A curated list of awesome monetization approaches for open-source software (with a slight bias towards open-source libraries (such as react.js, core-js, etc.) and not open-source programs (such as OpenOffice, MariaDB, etc.)).

TODO: overview / TOC with categories "Monetization approaches", "Monetization Risks/Dangers/Problems", "Reasons for & Opportunities of Monetization" (Burnout, etc.), "OSS Definition & Delimitation", "Other Motivations for OSS" (Learning, ...)
TODO: describe characteristics
TODO: add "Additional Work" (Low-High) as characteristic
TODO: add "Need for Legal Entity" (Low-High) as characteristic
TODO: add "Cost of Services" / "Upfront Cost" / "Continuous Cost" as characteristics? (e.g., certification hosting costs money)
TODO: Compedition: (M: only other maintainers, C: only M+Contributors, O: other Developers or Content creators)
TODO: mention CLA: May require a CLA (Contributor License Agreement) in order to accept code submissions from outside contributors while retaining the ability to relicense those submissions under the proprietary license

# Notes
If funds are being raised for a project (multiple maintainers or contributors - not a single individual), the following might also be required regardless of monetization approach:
* An extra bank account or fiscal host to collect the funding
* A distribution or usage model for the money (i.e., who (maintainers, contributors, etc.) or what (bug bounties, conferences, etc.) gets how much of the money?). Distribution might be implemented, e.g., objectively by number of features, bugfixes, LOC, etc. or subjectively determined by the maintainer(s) or by voting.
* The project may need to be incorporated and pay taxes (some legal forms may be tax-exempt, such as a non-profit entity (USA) or a registered association (Germany)).

If funds are being raised for an individual or distrituted from a fiscal host to an individual, the following might also be required regardless of monetization approach:
* The individual might need to pay taxes for the funding in their country
