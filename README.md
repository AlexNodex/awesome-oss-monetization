## Used Characteristics
In order to compare, evaluate, and explain the monetization approaches, several characteristics were used: 
* __Effort to set-up__: The amount of work required to start the monetization approach. [None; Low; Medium; High; N/A]
* __Effort to maintain income__: The amount of work needed to keep the monetization going. 
* __Visibility__: The ease with which a user of the OSS notices the monetization approach. 
* __Necessity to pay__: The need for the user of an OSS to accept and pay. 
* __Scalability__: The ease and number of users or companies that can be reached to pay. 
* __One-time Income__: The level of one single contribution. 
* __Recurring Income__: The level of monthly contribution that can be expected. 
* __Entry Threshold for client__: The amount of effort necessary to contribute money. 
* __Clients needed for full income__: The amount of payers necessary to get to 5k USD (pre-Tax) per month. 

* __Effort for marketing__: The amount of work necessary to make the monetization opportunity known to the public. 
* __Countervalue__: The value a contributor of money gets if he pays. 
* __Perfect for software type__: The types of OSS that would benefit the most from this onetization approach. 

* __Additional Work__: The amount of (continuous) work required in addition to working on the OSS. 
* __Upfront Cost__: The monetary cost to setup the monetization approach (e.g., for external services) - excluding cost for private bank accounts, tax advisors, etc. 
* __Continuous Cost__: The monetary cost to maintain the monetization approach over time (e.g., for the hosting of certificates)
* __Recipient__: The entity receiving the monetization result - and who might distribute it further (I: Individual, C: Collective/Company)
* __Competitors__: The kind of competitors for this monetization approach (M: Other maintainers, C: Contributors, O: Other Developers, Companies, or Content creators)

## Notes / Monetization Risks
If you want to monetize your open-source project several factors have to be considered:
* __Not having a License__: If the current version your project has no declared license, it's legal status in undefined and you should clarify it (esp. with other maintainers or contributors)
* __Not having a CLA__: If you're project does not have a CLA (Contributor License Agreement) the contributors still hold the full rights to their contributed source code and could sue against a monetization. If you want to monetize you should get them to sign a CLA, relicense their contributions, or remove their code (if possible).
* __Not having a concensus about monetization itself__ in the collective of all contributors can become a problem. If you want to monetize you should ask all contributors about if and how you want to monetize. A contract clarifying the willingness to monetize might be a good idea (Please ask a lawyer for help).
* __Not having a concensus about distribution of income__ in the collective can become a reason for dispute. If you want to monetize you should vote on how you want to distribute the income. The recipients of the money can be contributors but also bug bounties, conferences, or non-profits. A contract defining the distribution might be a good idea (Please ask a lawyer for help).
* __Receiving money as a private person__: might be a bad idea - esp. if it is meant for the project. The money would have to be taxed twice - first by the individual and then by the final recipient. Furthermore, the taxation depends on the country / jurisdiction the recipients live in (or pay taxes in if they are Digital Natives). If you collect money for the project it might be a good idea to use a fiscal host. As an individual it would be good to be registered as a Freelancer, to tax the income - but in some countries the normal income tax declaration might be sufficient (Please ask a tax advisor in your country).
* __Not paying taxes__ (as a project or individual) is always a bad idea. Even if you get only a dollar as a donation you should clarify how you have to declare the income and pay taxes (Please ask a tax advisor in your country).
* __Using a private bank account__ for collecting funds for your project is not a good idea. An extra bank account or fiscal host for the project to collect the funding and distribute it from there will help in being transparent.
