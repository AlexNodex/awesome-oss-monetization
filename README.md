# Awesome OSS Monetization
A curated list of awesome monetization approaches for open source software (currently probably with a slight bias towards open source libraries (like react.js, core-js, etc.) rather than open source programs (like OpenOffice, MariaDB, etc.)).

# Notes
If funds are being raised for a project (multiple maintainers or contributors - not a single individual), the following might also be required regardless of monetization approach:
* An extra bank account or fiscal host to collect the funding and distribute it from there
* A distribution or usage model for the money (i.e., who (maintainers, contributors, etc.) or what (bug bounties, conferences, etc.) gets how much of the money?). Distribution might be implemented, e.g., objectively by number of features, bugfixes, LOC, etc. or subjectively determined by the maintainer(s) or by voting.
* The project may need to be incorporated and pay itself taxes (some legal forms may be tax-exempt, such as a non-profit entity (USA) or a registered association (Germany)).

If funds are being raised for an individual or distrituted from a fiscal host to an individual, the following might also be required regardless of monetization approach:
* The individual might need to pay taxes for the funding in their country
