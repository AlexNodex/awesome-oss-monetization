# Notes
If funds are being raised for a project (multiple maintainers or contributors - not a single individual), the following might also be required regardless of monetization approach:
* An extra bank account or fiscal host to collect the funding
* A distribution or usage model for the money (i.e., who (maintainers, contributors, etc.) or what (bug bounties, conferences, etc.) gets how much of the money?). Distribution might be implemented, e.g., objectively by number of features, bugfixes, LOC, etc. or subjectively determined by the maintainer(s) or by voting.
* The project may need to be incorporated and pay taxes (some legal forms may be tax-exempt, such as a non-profit entity (USA) or a registered association (Germany)).

If funds are being raised for an individual or distrituted from a fiscal host to an individual, the following might also be required regardless of monetization approach:
* The individual might need to pay taxes for the funding in their country
